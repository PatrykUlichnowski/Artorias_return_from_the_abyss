<h1>Artorias return from the abyss</h1>

<h2>This game was made as a project for my classes</h2>

<p>There isn't anything really original about it, but it's still impresive project made by someone with 0 prior knowledge od Unity (at least i think so).</p>
<p>Please try it out and give feedback on this <a href="https://patrykulichnowski.itch.io/artorias">itch.io</a> page.</p>
<br> <p>Important: every graphic/sound/song/asset here is either free from some kind of asset store, or it's just stolen.</p>
